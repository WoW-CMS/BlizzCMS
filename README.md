**BlizzCMS plus**, is the improved version of **BlizzCMS v1** (which is an abandoned project). It is currently developed by the WOW-CMS community, and by independent contributors who make improvements to the code on a voluntary basis. It is currently **Open Source**, so everyone can study and improve the code, and it would be interesting that if you make improvements to it, you can share them with the community through a pull request.

## Some configurations

#### In linux (Apache Modules)

You can use the following command to enable the apache extensions mentioned above.

```sh
a2enmod headers
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod expires
```

#### Edit Sites Available

/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

For the mod_rewrite to work correctly and generate friendly URLs, it is necessary to have permissions on the directory where the CMS is located, commonly, located in `/var/www/html`.

```
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>
```

#### Restarting the service

```sh
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
